# Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), so be sure to install it first.
Running `poetry install --no-root --with dev` will install everything you need in an isolated virtual environment.

To add or remove dependencies, you can use the commands `poetry add $PACKAGE_NAME` and `poetry remove $PACKAGE_NAME`, respectively.
Be sure to commit the `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files to reflect any changes in dependencies.


# Load Testing

To measure inference throughput and latency, you can use [Locust](https://locust.io/) using the provided `locustfile.py`.
Locust works by querying the model endpoints and aggregating their statistics, meaning the app must be deployed.
You can change the models or adjust options like score thresholds through the Locust UI.

To get started, you can simply run `locust --web-host 127.0.0.1` and open `localhost:8089` in a browser to access the UI. See the [Locust documentation](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/index.html) for more info on running Locust. 

Note that in Locust's jargon, concurrency is measured in `users`, and each user runs one task at a time. To achieve a particular per-endpoint concurrency, multiply that number by the number of endpoints to be queried. For example, if there are 3 endpoints and you want each of them to receive 8 requests at a time, you should set the number of users to 24.
