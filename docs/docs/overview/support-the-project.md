# Support The Project

I am committed to this project, and I will not stop. I will keep updating the docs, adding new features, and fixing bugs. But I can't do it alone, so I need your help to give me additional motivation to keep going.

As our hosts in the [selfhosted.show - In the episode 'The-organization-which-must-not-be-named is a Hostile Actor'](https://selfhosted.show/79?t=1418) said, this is a massive undertaking that the team and I are doing. I would love to someday be able to do this full-time, and I am asking for your help to make that happen.

If you feel like this is the right cause and the app is something you see yourself using for a long time, please consider supporting the project with one of the options below.

## Contributing

There are lots of non-monetary ways to contribute to Immich as well.

1. Testing - Using Immich and reporting bugs is a great way to help support the project. Found a bug? [Open an issue on GitHub][github-issue].
1. Translations - The Immich mobile app has been translated into [17 languages][github-langs] so far! To contribute with translations, email me at alex.tran1502@gmail.com or send me a message on discord.
1. Development - If you are a programmer or developer, take a look at Immich's [technology stack](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) and consider fixing bugs or building new features. The team and I are always looking for new contributors. For information about how to contribute as a developer, see the [Developer](/docs/developer/architecture.mdx) section.
