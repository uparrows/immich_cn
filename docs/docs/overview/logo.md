# Logo

Why the colorful flower, you ask?

I really like the Japanese culture, especially the books, history, and food. The current logo is a spin-off of [the Oda clan's symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_clan).

One of my favorite books is [Taik≈ç](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/336228.Taiko), it is a story about a prominent figure in the history of Japan, [Toyotomi Hideyoshi](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Toyotomi-Hideyoshi). He came from nothing, and through his resilience and wonderful mind, he has become one of the most powerful rulers in Japan's history. I enjoy his personality and the way he moved through life.

The color is an adaptation of **_App-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named_**'s color scheme, with an extra color (pink) to complete the flower's fifth petal. The petal layers are the same color scheme as the main layer rotating back and forth to "bring the flower to life."
