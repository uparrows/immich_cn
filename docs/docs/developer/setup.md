# Setup

:::note
If there's a feature you're planning to work on, just give us a heads up in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/979116623879368755/1071165397228855327) so we can:

1. Let you know if it's something we would accept into Immich
2. Provide any guidance on how something like that would ideally be implemented
3. Ensure nobody is already working on that issue/feature so we don't duplicate effort

Thanks for being interested in contributing ðŸ˜Š

## Environment

### Server and web app

This environment includes the following services:

- Core server - `/server/src/immich`
- Machine learning - `/machine-learning`
- Microservices - `/server/src/microservicess`
- Web app - `/web`
- Redis
- PostgreSQL development database with exposed port `5432` so you can use any database client to acess it
- NGINX Proxy - `nginx/nginx.conf`

All the services are packaged to run as with single Docker Compose command.

### Instructions

1. Clone the project repo.
2. Run `cp docker/example.env docker/.env`.
3. Edit `docker/.env` to provide values for the required variable `UPLOAD_LOCATION`.
4. From the root directory, run:

```bash title="Start development server"
make dev # required Makefile installed on the system.
```

5. Access the dev instance in your browser at http://localhost:2283, or connect via the mobile app.

All the services will be started with hot-reloading enabled for a quick feedback loop.

You can access the web from `http://your-machine-ip:2283` or `http://localhost:2283` and access the server from the mobile app at `http://your-machine-ip:2283/api`

### Mobile app

The mobile app `(/mobile)` will required Flutter toolchain 3.13.x to be installed on your system.

Please refer to the [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for more information on setting up the toolchain on your machine.

### Connect to a remote backend

If you only want to do web development connected to an existing, remote backend, follow these steps:

1. Enter the web directory - `cd web/`
2. Install web dependencies - `npm i`
3. Start the web development server

```
IMMICH_SERVER_URL=https://demo.immich.app/api npm run dev
```

## IDE setup

### Lint / format extensions

Setting these in the IDE give a better developer experience, auto-formatting code on save, and providing instant feedback on lint issues.

### Dart Code Metris

The mobile app uses DCM (Dart Code Metrics) for linting and metrics calculation. Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://dcm.dev/docs/getting-started/#installation) page for more information on setting up DCM

Note: Activating the license is not required.

### VSCode

Install `Flutter`, `DCM`, `Prettier`, `ESLint` and `Svelte` extensions.

in User `settings.json` (`cmd + shift + p` and search for `Open User Settings JSON`) add the following:

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[javascript][typescript][css]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
  "[svelte]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "svelte.svelte-vscode",
    "editor.tabSize": 2
  },
  "svelte.enable-ts-plugin": true,
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "svelte"],
  "[dart]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.selectionHighlight": false,
    "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false,
    "editor.suggestSelection": "first",
    "editor.tabCompletion": "onlySnippets",
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "Dart-Code.dart-code"
  }
}
```
