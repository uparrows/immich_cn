## OpenAPI

The OpenAPI client libraries need to be regenerated whenever there are changes to the `immich-openapi-specs.json` file. Note that you should not modify this file directly as it is auto-generated. See [OpenAPI](/docs/developer/open-api.md) for more details.

## Database Migrations

A database migration needs to be generated whenever there are changes to `server/src/infra/src/entities`. See [Database Migration](/docs/developer/database-migrations.md) for more details.
